# Password-Generator

## User Story
As an employee with access to sensitive data
I want to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
So that I can create a strong password that provides greater security.

This was a week 3 homework for the coding bootcamp at the University of Denver.
I was tasked to create a randomized password generator - with the goal of adding code to the JS file.

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
